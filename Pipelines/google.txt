Google is one of the most influential technology companies in the world, fundamentally shaping how billions of people access and interact with information online. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, Google began as a research project focused on improving internet search through a novel algorithm called PageRank. This algorithm ranked web pages based on their relevance and the number of quality links pointing to them, rather than simply counting keyword matches. What started in a garage quickly evolved into a company that would revolutionize the digital age, with its search engine becoming so ubiquitous that "Google" itself became a verb synonymous with online searching.

Beyond its core search business, Google has expanded into a vast ecosystem of products and services that touch nearly every aspect of digital life. Gmail transformed email with its generous storage capacity and powerful search functionality. Google Maps revolutionized navigation and local discovery, while YouTube, acquired in 2006, became the world's largest video-sharing platform. The Android operating system powers the majority of smartphones globally, and Google Chrome has become the world's most popular web browser. The company has also ventured into cloud computing, artificial intelligence, smart home devices, and even experimental projects like self-driving cars through its various divisions.

Google's business model primarily relies on advertising, with the company dominating the digital advertising market alongside competitors like Meta. Through its sophisticated ad platforms, Google Ads and AdSense, the company connects advertisers with users across its search engine, YouTube, and millions of partner websites. This advertising-driven model has made Google extraordinarily profitable, though it has also raised questions about user privacy, data collection, and the company's market power. The company collects vast amounts of data to personalize ads and improve its services, which has led to ongoing debates about privacy rights and regulatory scrutiny from governments worldwide.

In 2015, Google underwent a major corporate restructuring, becoming a subsidiary of a new parent company called Alphabet Inc. This reorganization allowed Google to focus on its core internet products while separating out more experimental ventures like life sciences research, investment arms, and moonshot projects into distinct Alphabet subsidiaries. Today, under CEO Sundar Pichai, Google continues to invest heavily in artificial intelligence and machine learning, viewing these technologies as central to its future. The company faces significant challenges including antitrust investigations, competition in the AI space from companies like OpenAI and Microsoft, and ongoing concerns about content moderation, misinformation, and its societal impact. Despite these challenges, Google remains a dominant force in technology, with its services reaching billions of users daily and its innovations continuing to shape the digital landscape.
